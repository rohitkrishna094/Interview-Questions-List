  "answer": "Spring targets to make Java EE development easier. Here are the advantages of using it:\n* Lightweight: there is a slight overhead of using the framework in development \n* Inversion of Control (IoC): Spring container takes care of wiring dependencies of various objects, instead of creating or looking for dependent objects \n*Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP): Spring supports AOP to separate business logic from system services\n*IoC container: it manages Spring Bean life cycle and project specific configurations\n*MVC framework: that is used to create web applications or RESTful web services, capable of returning XML/JSON responses\n*Transaction management: reduces the amount of boiler-plate code in JDBC operations, file uploading, etc., either by using Java annotations or by Spring Bean XML configuration file\n*Exception Handling: Spring provides a convenient API for translating technology-specific exceptions into unchecked exceptions."
